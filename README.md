# OpenDXMC
Monte Carlo dose simulator for diagnostic x-ray (ALPHA)

OpenDXMC is an application to calculate and visualize dose distributions in diagnostic x-ray examinations. The application is currently in early development and the first alpha release is currently available.  

Dose calculations are done by the Monte Carlo method optimized for a voxelized geometry. However only photons are modelled and essentially only KERMA is scored. The current code is oriented towards modelling radiation doses from conventional CT scanners. The application supports dose calculations on a) CT series of individiual patients and b) digitial phantoms from Virtual Human Database created by Helmholtz Zentrum research center (http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/en/amsd/service/scientific-services/virtual-human-database/). The phantoms are not distributed along with the application due to licensing, but a free license and permission to download the phantoms can be found at Virtual Human Database homepage.
