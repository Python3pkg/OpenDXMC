# OpenDXMC
Monte Carlo dose simulator for diagnostic x-ray (ALPHA)

OpenDXMC is an application to calculate and visualize dose distributions in diagnostic x-ray examinations. The application is currently in early development and the first alpha release is scheduled to 15/jan-16. 

Dose calculations are done by the Monte Carlo method optimized for a voxelized geometry. However only photons are modelled and essentially only KERMA is scored.
